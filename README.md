# portfolio-generator
This program creates an HTML portfolio page, and you’ll do it without ever touching an HTML file! Instead, 
you’ll use the command line to capture user input and place it in a JavaScript function that provides the finished HTML page as output.
With a Node.js application, we don't have to worry about that! We only have to create a JavaScript file and use the command line to execute it.
We use the JavaScript language to tell applications what to do.
JavaScript facilitates a smoother experience for the developer.
